This application is an example of how to create a Kafka producer and a consumer where the consumer is able to consume messages and in turn write the consumed 
records to a data source.  For this example the data source is Cassandra but the can be modified to send to any number of data sources such as MySQL or Postgres. 

In order to run this example it is necessary to have a Kafka cluster as well as Cassandra cluster. 


Step 1 produce messages
java -jar oss-kafka-cassandra-1.0.jar producer videos 127.0.0.1:9092 VideoProducer a1

Step 2 view / check messages
kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic videos --from-beginning

Step 3 consume and write messages
java -jar oss-kafka-cassandra-1.0.jar consumer videos 127.0.0.1:9092 VideoConsumerAndSenderWithThread a2

additional

remove topic, to repeat the above steps

kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181 --topic videos --delete
